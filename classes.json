The choreography acts as a grounding guideline but the point is to make it your own!

If you know me, you know that we\u2019ll probably sweat. Bring water, an extra shirt if you want it, and maybe a snack. These classes will be working on body movement, rhythm fundamentals, and classic jazz steps. The choreography will be a combination of everything! For maximum comfort, expect to practice ;)",
